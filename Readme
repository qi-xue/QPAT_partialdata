This is the Matlab source code for our paper "HÃ¶lder stability of quantitative photoacoustic tomography based on partial data" by Faouzi TRIKI and Qi XUE.
The code is far from optimal. Actually we repeat the same code in each example folder.
You can go into the corresponding folder and run the "main" file therein to regenerate figures presented in our paper.
If you want to know the detail implementation, just search into the corresponding file.

You have all authority to use, modify and spread the code for research use only.
For any commercial use, you need to contact us.
We'll be grateful if you could cite our paper if you use our code in your research.
We're not responsible for any consequence induced by this set of code.
We'll be very glad to hear any of your comments, but we cannot guarantee that you will receive our support.s
